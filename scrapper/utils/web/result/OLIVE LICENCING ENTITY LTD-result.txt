The investment strategy of Olive is based on three main pillars: wholesome investing (investing in projects and businesses that positively impact Australian society), simplicity and approachability (making the investment journey easy and effective), and competitive returns (investing in projects that meet the wholesome investment strategy and exceed expectations). They emphasize investment in the healthcare sector due to its steady cash generation, high margins, and low cyclicality, which is beneficial as healthcare spending increases with an aging population.
